This is a portfolio repository containing the C# scripts written for my game, Sons of Ra, organized as they are within the project source.

The features contained within that were the results of my most significant efforts include:
	- The main Player script, which contains the driver for the radial UI that is used for all
	    in-game actions (SonsOfRaScripts/Player/HumanPlayerController.cs, PlayerController.cs)
	- Controllers for our rudimentary AI opponent (scripts within SonsOfRaScripts/Player/AI/)
	- Networked Multiplayer, allowing two players to connect via Steam's API to play together 
	    remotely via peer-to-peer networking (distributed throughout the source code and in multiple scripts)
	- Controller code for the vast majority of non-gameplay UI systems
	- Unit AI controllers and behaviors (SonsOfRaScripts/UnitBehaviors/)
